                omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or
                any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any
                provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content
                would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete
                your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register

                submitted or created using our Services by you. Unless
                specifically permitted by you, your use of the Website does not
                grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish
                or distribute the Content created by you or stored in your user
                account for commercial, marketing or any similar purpose. But

                account solely as required for the purpose of providing the

                or warranties, we have the right, though not the obligation, to,
                in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that,

                with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time
                a fee or charge is due and payable. Sensitive and private data
                exchange happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is

                you to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued
                photo identification, and possibly a copy of a recent bank
                statement for the credit or debit card used for the purchase. We
                reserve the right to change products and product pricing at any
                time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order you place
                with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel
                quantities purchased per person, per household or per order.
                These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the
                same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that
                use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that
                we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify
                you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number
                provided at the time the order was made.{' '}
